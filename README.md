# CurrenciesApp

* App maked in React js, to ran it you must install those dependencies:
    npm install axios
    npm install --save react-router-dom
    npm install uuid
    npm install bootstrap
    In a separated terminal: json-server --watch currencies.json --port 3001

* This is simple application, based on CRUD architecture
I used json.server to make FAKE REST API, which gives me a simple base
For fetchin data, I used AXIOS

* CurreniciesApp allows you to view all currencies that we can change and delete
It can also be added new one, which is not in database
